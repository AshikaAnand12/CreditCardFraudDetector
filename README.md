## CI Pipeline
1. Upload data after downloading from above links - Data Injection
2. Data obtained has undergone PCA since it is confidential and we have performed cleaning and classification for fraud and normal records - Data preparation
3. Used autoencoder with 50 epochs for Model training
4. Model has been stored as ".h5" [[CAN PICKLE AND STORE IN DRIVE]]
